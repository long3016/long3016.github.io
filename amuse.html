        <h2>Pointer Pointer</h2>

        <p>All that have to do is load the website and move your mouse pointer. Wherever you move the pointer, the website will automatically generate an image of a person pointing at it. Don't believe me? I've sat for minutes at a time trying to find a spot it can't point to.</p>

        <h2>Endless Horse</h2>

        <p>Out of all the websites I have visited, this one is by far the longest one. No matter how far you scroll down, the horse is never ending. He just keeps growing.</p>

        <h2>Cat Bounce</h2>
        <img src="https://laughingsquid.com/wp-content/uploads/Cat-Bounce.jpg" alt="Cats bouncing across the screen" width="50%" height="auto">
        <p>Just like the name suggest, this site is all about cats bouncing. Allowing you to move the cats around and bounce across the screen, it is a great mindless activity. Plus with an extra surprise when you hit <em>Make It Rain</em>.</p>
