<h3>About</h3>
<p>As an artists, I often gravitate towards others especially those that radiate passion for their work. One of my inspirations is John Powell, a musical composer for several well known works, such as <em>How To Train Your Dragon</em>, <em>Solo: A Star Wars Story</em>, and <em>Rio</em>.</p>
<p>His work is so wildly inspirational that his 2010 score for the film <em>How To Train Your Dragon</em> earned his first Academy Award nomination at the 83rd Axademy Award Ceremony!</p>
<p>John Powell inspires me to learn from others, for years he started his career as an assistant to Patrick Doyle, a famous Scottish Composer. <br> By making those connections and learning from others, his work is ever growing while still inspiring others to create and find their passion for art. </p>
